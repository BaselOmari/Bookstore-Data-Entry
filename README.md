# BookstoreDataEntry
Data Collection Assistant for Readers Bookstore. 

Program accesses mass amounts of ISBN Numbers all stored in excel sheets, and searches for the necessary information (Publisher, Cover Type, Abstract, etc.) using the Google Books API, and stores important information back into the excel spreadsheet.

Program was used to organize information and data entry needed to build the Readers Bookstore website.
